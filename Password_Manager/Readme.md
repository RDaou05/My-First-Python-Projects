# Password Manager

## How it works

This password manager stores all the passowrds in a file on your computer. When you first run it, it will prompt you for a Master Password to be entered. After this, if you forget your master password, you will recive an email (Which you will also be asked to enter the first time you run the program) to enter a 2FA code to reset your master password.

## Features

1. Generate Passwords
2. Save Passwords
3. See saved passwords
4. Delete passwords
5. See your master password (If you complete the email 2FA)
6. Change your master password (If you complete the email 2FA)
7. Change your email (If you enter your master password in correctly)

## WARNING

I created this password a while ago, so I did not include a very good encryption system.
