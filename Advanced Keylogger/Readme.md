## How it works and How to use it

The program will attempt to install the nessecary modules for the keylogger automatically.

Before you user the program, go to `lines 23 and 24` to enter the email and password that you want the logs to be emailed to. Also if you are using gmail, you will have to allow third party apps. You can do that by going to this link `https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps`.

This keylogger will email you the information after a certain amount of time has passed and a certain amount of keys have been pressed. The default is 5 seconds and 20 keys. You can change these setting by going to `lines 66 and 68`.
